Drop pins on a map, then load pictures from Flickr based on the coordinates.

## Project Overivew (via Udacity)
The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

## Details
Core Data is used to store map pin locations and associated photos pulled from Flickr using their API.
